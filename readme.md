## üö® Limitations

- **No Real Delivery/Bounce Tracking:**  
  The app cannot detect if an email address actually exists or if delivery failed (bounced).  
  Google Apps Script's `MailApp.sendEmail()` only checks if the email address is syntactically valid (e.g., contains `@`).  
  If you enter a fake but valid-looking address, the app will report it as "sent"‚Äîeven if it never reaches a real inbox.
- **Bounces:**  
  If an email bounces, you may receive a bounce notification in your Gmail inbox, but this is not visible to the app or included in the campaign summary.
- **Syntax Validation Only:**  
  The app will only count as "failed" those addresses that are obviously malformed.
